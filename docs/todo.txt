improve models 
    compare performance with and without outliers
    apply RFE or other technique to adjust parameters
    potentially resolve data imbalance - compare resampling with stratified data
    resampling - applied, need to compare with/without/potentially consider implementing SMOTE
    hyperparameter tuning - done, just need to run, selection of hyperparameters limited by computing power and time

data analysis
    find feature importance from models 
    learning curves
    run statistical test between finished models
    write tests

interface   
    create interface using best performing model
