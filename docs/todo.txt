improve models 
    compare performance with and without outliers
    potentially resolve data imbalance - compare resampling with stratified data
    iteratively improve models
    apply RFE or other technique to adjust parameters
    resampling - applied, need to compare with/without/potentially consider implementing SMOTE
    hyperparameter tuning - done, just need to run

data analysis
    add additional analysis
    run analysis on finished models
    implement traditional algorithm and compare 
    find feature importance from models 
    learning curves
    run statistical test between finished models

interface   
    create interface using best performing model
